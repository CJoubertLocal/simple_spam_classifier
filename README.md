# Simple spam classifier

This repository contains code which shows the development of a simple spam classification algorithm. This was undertaken as part of coursework for the ECS784P Data Analytics class at Queen Mary.

The model uses the spambase data set from the UCI repository Source: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase].

Please see the 'simple_spam_filter_report' for a write up detailing decisions taken during this project, and 'simple_spam_filter_code.ipynb' for the code used to clean and analyse the data set.
